# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

W. Avy is impressed with the analysis previously created and presented to the board on precipitation in Oahu and the number of stations the statistics is retrieved from. 
In order to further develop this analysis, he has asked us for more information on temperature trends specifically in June and Decemmber in Oahu. Since these are prime months for vacation for many people, we will review the temperature during these months to ensure it is ideal for attracting tourists to the surf and ice cream shop.

We will first determine the summary statistics for June followed by December to evaluate the overall temperature for each month. 

## Results

As displayed in the image below on the summary statistics for June, we can make the following observations:

- Mean Temperature is about 75 Degrees F, this is relatively warm temperature for ice cream and surfing. Althought it's not hot, based on this it might be beneficial to offer wet suits since it can be much cooler being in the ocean. 
- Standard Deviation is 3.25, meaning this is an average deviation from the mean and results are more or less close to the average with a few outliers
- The Maximum temperature reaches a high of 85 Degrees F and low of 64 Degrees F; Temperature is still warm and ideal for surfing in June

Below are the results for December displayed in Image 2, based on these results we can make the following observations:

- Mean Temperature is 71 Degrees F, which is on the cooler end for the month of December since this doesn't account for wind and other cooling factors.
- The maximum temperature is 83 Degrees F and a low of 56 Degrees F; This is concerning since 56F is very cold for surfing
- Lower quartile percentile of 25% is 69 Degrees F, meaning only 25% of the results are lower than 69F, majority is still roughly around 69-74F

Based on the results above we can note the following key differences between the 2 months:
- It is much cooler in December versus June with a minimum temperature of 56F vs 64F in June
- There is a higher standard deviation in December, meaning there is less outliers vs June
- The maximum temperatures are very close between 83F and 85F in December and June respectively

As a recommendation it is suggested to keep the shop open all of June, however in December it may be ideal to have it open on the warmer days and shut the shop during cooler days.
During holiday weeks its perfect to keep it open to attract tourists who usually come to hawaii for the sole purpose of surfing. This month is ideal to increase stock in wet suits for cooler days.

We can take this analysis further, and take a look at precipitation for these 2 months to determine if it is still ideal to keep the shop open with rain being another factor. 
Based on the image below, for the month of June the mean levels for precipitation is roughly 13mm, with a minimum of 0 and median of 2mm. 
The only concern would be the maximum amount of rain being over 4cm, which may be due to tropical storms that are normal for islands. This would most likely be an outlier.

**Image 3: June Precipitation**

For the month of December, the mean level of rain is 22mm, with the median falling at 3mm. The 75th percentile is 15mm so there is still quite a bit of rain compared to June.
With that being said, the maximum level of rain is over 6cm, so December seems to have more rain with a lot of the data being skewed due to a poor standard deviation.

After observing the extra analysis, it is recommended to keep the shop open all of June. For the month of December it is recommended to observe weather and open based on the weather analysis.
